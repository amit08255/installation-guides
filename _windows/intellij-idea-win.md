## What is a IntelliJ IDEA?
IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, by JetBrains. It attempts to integrate all of the development tools that you might need into one single place.

There is a Community Edition that is available for a [free download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## Installation
