  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="whats-nodejs--and-npm">What’s Node.js®  and NPM?</h2>
<p>Node.js® is a JavaScript-based environment which you can use to create web-servers and networked applications. You can also use it to perform helpful tasks on your computer such as concatenating and minifying JavaScript files and compiling Sass files into CSS.</p>

<p>NPM is a “package manager” that makes installing Node “packages” fast and easy. A package is just a code library that extends Node by adding useful features. For example, the “request” package simplifies the process of making HTTP request so you can easily get web resources from other sites.</p>

<p>NPM is installed when you install Node.js®</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You should have some familiarity with the Linux terminal</strong> since you’ll need to use it to install and test Node and NPM. You’ll also need the terminal to use Node.js and NPM.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependencies.</strong> You need to install a number of dependancies before you can install Node.js and NPM. 
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>GCC</strong>. You’ll need Ruby 1.8.6 or newer and GCC 4.2 or newer. 
        <ul>
          <li>For <strong>Ubuntu</strong> or <strong>Debian</strong> based Linux distributions run the following command in your terminal <code>sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git m4 ruby texinfo libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libexpat-dev libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev</code> and select Y to continue and wait for the packages to be installed.  </li>
          <li>For <strong>Fedora</strong> based Linux distributions run the following command in your terminal application <code>sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' &amp;&amp; sudo yum install curl git m4 ruby texinfo bzip2-devel curl-devel expat-devel ncurses-devel zlib-devel</code>and select Y to continue and wait for the packages to be installed.  </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Homebrew</strong>. Homebrew is a package manager originally for the Mac but has been ported to Linux – Linuxbrew – it makes installing most open source software (like Node) as simple as writing <code>brew install node</code>. You can learn more about Homebrew at the <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew website</a> and Linuxbrew at the <a href="http://brew.sh/linuxbrew">Linuxbrew website</a>. To install Homebrew for Linux open your terminal application and paste in the command <code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"</code>. Follow the instructions in the terminal to complete the installation process.  </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once Linuxbrew is installed. You’ll need add to your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> file the following 3 lines:   </p>

<p><code>
export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
</code></p>

<h2 id="installation-overview">Installation Overview</h2>
<p>Installing Node.js® and NPM is pretty straightforward using Linuxbrew, the Linux port of Homebrew. It handles downloading, unpacking, compiling and installing Node and NPM on your system. The whole process (after you have Linuxbrew installed) should only take you a few minutes.</p>

<h2 id="installation-steps">Installation Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Open up your terminal</strong> and type <code>brew install node</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Sit back and wait.</strong> Homebrew has to download some files, compile and install them. But that’s it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="test-it">Test it!</h2>
<p>Make sure you have Node and NPM installed by running simple commands to see what version of each is installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Test Node.js.</strong> To see if Node.js is installed, type <code>node -v</code> in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this <code>v0.10.35</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Test NPM.</strong> To see if NPM is installed, type <code>npm -v</code> in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this <code>2.1.17</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-update-node-and-npm">How to Update Node and NPM</h2>
<p>New versions of Node and NPM come out frequently. You can use Homebrew to update the software it installs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure Homebrew has the latest version of the Node package. In Terminal type 
<code>brew update</code></li>
  <li>Upgrade Node: <code>brew upgrade node</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-uninstall-node-and-npm">How to Uninstall Node and NPM</h2>
<p>You can use Homebrew to uninstall packages that it installed:</p>

<p><code>brew uninstall node</code></p>
